# cursor-physics
## Overview
This repository contains interactive simulations that visualize particle physics concepts through objects like sheets and balls. The behavior of these objects is controlled by mouse/cursor movements, simulating how particles interact with forces.

## Features
- Particle motion simulations reacting to cursor movements.
- Sheet and ball physics with interactive deformations and collisions.
- Visualizations of particle dynamics influenced by user input.
